# Scope of Work:

    - What will the finished product look like?
    The finished product will be a single page website hosted on GitHub pages.

    - What metrics can I use to determine that the project is "finished"?

# Constraints:

    - If at all possible, we would perfer to NOT host our own database.

    - If at all possible, we would perfer to NOT handle sensitive user data.

# Assumptions:

    - We assume our end-user to be using a modern browser.

    - We assume our end-user to be non-disabled.

# Dependencies:

    - Be able to justify each of your dependencies:

    - "This repository makes use of the `` library..."

# Requirements:

    - Non-Functional Requirements is to System Architecture
      as Functional Requirements is to System Design

    - Put another way:

    	- What it's supposed to do vs. How it does it

# Features:

    - (What are you looking at me for? This is the part that /you/ fill out!)
