# Scope of Work:

    - What will the finished product look like?
    The finished product will be a single page website hosted on GitHub pages.

    - What metrics can I use to determine that the project is "finished"?
    When it's finished, the project will include these sections:
    * About me
    * My Poshmark listings (if any)
    * My eBay listings (if any)
    * My Etsy listings (if any)

    Ideally I'd like a carousel of photos for each section. Not sure what to do when there aren't enough items to fill out a single screen of the carousel.

# Constraints:

    - If at all possible, we would prefer to NOT host our own database.

    - If at all possible, we would prefer to NOT handle sensitive user data.

# Assumptions:

    - We assume our end-user to be using a modern browser.

    - We assume our end-user to be non-disabled.

# Dependencies:

    - Be able to justify each of your dependencies:

    - "This repository makes use of the `` library..."

# Requirements:

    - Non-Functional Requirements is to System Architecture
      as Functional Requirements is to System Design

    - Put another way:

    	- What it's supposed to do vs. How it does it

    This site will let my customers on Poshmark, eBay, and Etsy see all the item's I'm selling on the other platforms. An About Me section will present me as a responsible seller with quality items and fast shipping.

    All of my listings on Poshmark, eBay, and Etsy have photos and text (title and description) on those platforms. For my site I want to pull the main photo and the title and display in a carousel.

# Features:

    - TBA
